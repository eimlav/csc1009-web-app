 CSC1009 Web App Assignment
  Emotional Music Database
= = = = = = = = = = = = = =
As the core assignment of one of this Level 1 module, I was a member of an externally 
selected team in which we had to build a web app running on a local Apache web server. 
A variety of project topics were provided from which we had to select one. We chose to
build a web app which focused on allowing the user to search for music based on the 
emotions associated with that piece of music. The team consisted of four members. I 
was tasked with building the search functionality, which was the core part of the web 
app. In addition, I also implemented the streaming page for playing a song as well as
playlist functionality, which provided the user with the ability to create and share 
their own playlists.
